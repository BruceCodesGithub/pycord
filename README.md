# The Original Pycord Guide

This is the First Guide created for Pycord that explains how to use Pycord and it's features.

## Past

Pycord Guide initially used to be on GitBook. However, I later decided on MKDocs after the suggestions of various people.

## Future

Since the [Official Pycord Guide](https://github.com/Pycord-Development/guide) is now here, I will be archiving this repo and instead contribute to the Official Guide.

After all, I am pretty much the only person maintaining this Guide (of course, I can't forget all the valuable suggestions by the Pycord community).

So check out the Official Guide instead!
